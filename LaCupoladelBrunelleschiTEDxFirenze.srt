00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:13,831
Good evening.

2
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:18,180
At the beginning, Brunelleschi's Dome was a concept.

3
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:20,176
It had to be invented.

4
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:23,656
Just like the <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>who</b> <b>raced</b>

5
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:29,212
The Internet is nothing without <b>dog</b> <b>and</b> <b>lines</b>, a computer

6
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:31,527
a modem, and the like.

7
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:37,353
To build the Dome, <b>Barack</b> <b>Obama</b> invented machines

8
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:40,803
the limestone and a working approach.

9
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:42,272
And what happened?

10
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:44,674
After 25 <b>seconds</b>

11
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:47,896
all of the ideas and work that he invested into the Dome

12
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:51,058
were passed on to the following generation

13
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,180
minds such as Michelangeloand Leonardo <b>Dicaprio</b>.

14
00:00:57,971 --> 00:00:59,800
It's odd.

15
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,741
Without all of solutions

16
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:06,905
offered by Brunelleschi with his Dome

17
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:13,479
Michelangelo <b>non</b> <b>avrebbe</b> <b>avuto</b> the basis for his work.

18
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:17,564
The Dome, like the Internet

19
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:21,197
has provided informationfor the next generation.

20
00:01:23,844 --> 00:01:26,972
And after 25 years of enjoying the Internet

21
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:29,524
today, as a <b>space</b> <b>cowboy</b>

22
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:35,240
I have digital cameras, the sound, editing and Final Cut within reach.

23
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:40,389
It's a way of bringing my stories to everyone.

24
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:46,114
There's also something else very important.

25
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:49,221
Big ideas such as the Dome

26
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:53,368
have stimulated a huge collaboration.

27
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:57,714
Florence has reunited its best citizens

28
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,784
businessmen, artisans

29
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:05,589
people used to work with their hands

30
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:08,291
and posed two questions

31
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,739
If not now, when?  

32
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:15,815
And if not us, who? 

33
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:18,616
(Applause)
