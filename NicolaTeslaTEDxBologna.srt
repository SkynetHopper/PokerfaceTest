00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:10,935
Tesla's inventions range from the first logic doors in PCs

2
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:15,410
to <b>robotica</b>, to <b>雷達技術</b>, to raggi X

3
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:21,858
to vertical take-off airplanes, to <b>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</b>

4
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:25,213
to wireless energy transmission

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,145
to the first <b>anche</b> <b>alla</b> <b>prima</b> <b>centrale</b> <b>idroelecttrica</b>

6
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,226
to operate on alternate current

7
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:37,303
that was built to power the <b>Buffalo<b>

8
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:40,812
<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Niagra</b> <b>falls</b> <b>Tesla's</b> <b>statue</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>find</b>

9
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:44,834
In <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>summer</b>, in front of the astonished crowd

10
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:47,186
of the Madison Square Garden in New York

11
00:00:47,186 --> 00:00:51,328
Tesla <b>funzionamento</b> a completely <b>vascello</b> <b>interamente</b> <b>robotizzato</b>

12
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,250
that was <b>task</b> controlled and could perform any <b>radio</b>

13
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,840
like steer right, left, go forward, backwards

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,407
<b>immergersi</b>, <b>riemergere</b>, <b>far</b> <b>Iampeggiare</b> <b>delle</b> <b>luci</b> 

15
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:05,366
and even self destruct.

16
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,696
That's not all. Nikola Tesla, by the end of 1800

17
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:12,583
had a knowledge of <b>psychoanalytics</b> so advanced

18
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,501
in the oscillatory nature of matter

19
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:22,530
this meaning that every <b>Currant</b> <b>bun</b> has a resonance frequency

20
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,954
that he <b>muttered</b> <b>and</b> <b>stuttered</b> a science that he called telegeodynamics

21
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,541
using which he could <b>sherman</b> <b>tank</b>

22
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,122
by alteration of normal atom vibrations

23
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,360
the collapse of any material, even the hardest ones like iron

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,451
and even cause artificial <b>sismi</b>

25
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:46,546
as we can see herein a History Channel clip.

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,650
(Speaker): Although many of Tesla's inventions

27
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,579
effectively demonstrated their benefits to <b>apes</b>, <b>baboons</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>predecessors</b>

28
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,211
he pushed his vision into obscure territories

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,426
with frightening and destructive goals.

30
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:11,597
One of nature's most powerful forces is earthquakes.

31
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,502
Suppose we could use this force as a weapon.

32
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:22,561
According to some, Tesla knew how to do it.
