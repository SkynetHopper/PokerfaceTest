00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,550
[applause]

2
00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:12,059
Good morning!

3
00:00:12,573 --> 00:00:14,435
[applause]

4
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:15,559
Good morning!

5
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:20,257
Many - uhm no - I'll start differently.

6
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:23,169
What's going through your mind, ...

7
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:26,502
... if you meet a person with a disability in everyday life?

8
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:30,344
I wonder the same thing...

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,955
Okay. You'll ask yourself now:

10
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,738
Why am I thinking this? Surely I should know by now...

11
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:40,351
But every time I see a person with a disability in everyday life, ...

12
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:42,475
... I ask myself two questions.

13
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,732
The first question: What does he have?

14
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:49,188
And the second question: How does he do it?

15
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:52,867
So: What does he have? For example: Why can't he see me?

16
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:53,959
Why can't he hear me?

17
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:55,566
Why can't he understand me?

18
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:58,411
Or: Why is he sitting in a wheelchair?

19
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:02,742
And the other question is: How does he do it?

20
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:05,127
How does he get out of the bed in the morning?

21
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:06,507
Does he need help?

22
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:07,568
Does he have a job?

23
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:09,888
Does he have a girlfriend? Do they have sex?

24
00:01:12,182 --> 00:01:13,074
And ...

25
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:16,567
... although one in ten of us here in Germany does have a disability ...

26
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,364
... and although there are 1.6 million people in wheelchairs ...

27
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:21,665
... - the terrible figure worldwide is - ...

28
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:23,693
... uhm, no.

29
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:27,054
So, assuming there are 85 million people in wheelchairs worldwide.

30
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:29,489
Worldwide, the horrible figure is three times higher.

31
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:32,582
Although there are many people with disabilities around, ...

32
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:35,821
... - in this room, every 10th person should have a disability, ...

33
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,274
... I'm one of them - ...

34
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:38,373
... uhm ...

35
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:40,840
... they don't show up in everyday life.

36
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:43,291
And the question is: Why?

37
00:01:44,183 --> 00:01:46,755
For Germany, I have an explanation:

38
00:01:47,018 --> 00:01:50,144
In Germany, the social state was established ...

39
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:52,579
... right after World War II.

40
00:01:52,607 --> 00:01:55,021
And in the 50s and 60s they said:

41
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,636
"Okay we need optimal support for people with disabilities ...

42
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:00,784
... in the best possible circumstances."

43
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:04,001
Back then in the 50s 60s it was "state of the art" ...

44
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:05,056
... to park people with disabilitiesâ€¦

45
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:08,042
... in special facilities on the urban fringe ...

46
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:10,375
 - literally "on the fringes of society" - ...

47
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:11,904
... which still exist today.

48
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:14,128
They are called ...

49
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,551
... 'sheltered workshops' 'homes for the disabled' ...

50
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:19,358
... or - today - 'special (education) schools'.

51
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:20,382
Uhm.

52
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:22,926
The only thing that has changed are the names ...

53
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,663
... but finally these are kinds of ...

54
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,738
... parallel worlds.

55
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:28,487
Those ...

56
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:30,985
... are - as said - special schools ...

57
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:35,075
... are where people with disabilities of different kinds are put together in one class.

58
00:02:35,105 --> 00:02:38,279
Uhm. So it follows that the transition from this system ...

59
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,858
... into our regular school systems is very difficult...

60
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:45,873
... Just 0,01 % of the pupils there will take their high-school diplomas.

61
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:47,431
That means, ...

62
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,116
... they are kept in a parallel world, ...

63
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:52,535
... which deeply alters their experience of life. Then, they go into ...

64
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,952
... so-called 'educational institutions', ...

65
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:56,587
... to learn office assistance.

66
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,079
I know so many people in wheelchairs, who ...

67
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:02,389
... became office management assistants.

68
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:03,995
Uhm.

69
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:06,019
This is why - how should I say that - ...

70
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:08,635
... people with disabilities don't show up in our everyday life.

71
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,434
And if you visit these facilities ...

72
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:13,819
... and I got to know some - my mother worked in one - ...

73
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,254
... if you visit these facilities and look into the faces of people who go to school there, ...

74
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,263
... or do their training there, ...

75
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:21,711
... then ...

76
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:26,002
... I have the feeling that you'll see a special kind of sadness in their faces.

77
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,936
And if you ask them: "Tell me, what's up? What do you actually want to do when you grow up?

78
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:31,458
What do you want to be?"

79
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:34,622
Then, most of the time they will say: "I don't know."

80
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:36,609
And ...

81
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:39,980
... "Why don't you know?" "Well, the world out there is so difficult."

82
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,097
"The world of the non-disabled out there ...

83
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:45,173
... is difficult. It is non-wheelchair-accessible, whatsoever."

84
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:49,914
And I was lucky that I could go to a normal integration school ...

85
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:53,130
... and certainly, I can confirm: the world outside there is brutal.

86
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:55,881
The world out there is brutal for people in wheelchairs.

87
00:03:55,921 --> 00:04:00,334
Mailboxes - uhm, nonsense - we always have to make a detour, yes.

88
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:04,128
Mailboxes are too high.

89
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:07,414
ATMs - we can't reach them.

90
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,615
The question is: How do we reach them? We would - well: How do we withdraw our money?

91
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:13,470
We tell total strangers our PIN.

92
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:16,644
As if that's not dangerous...

93
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:20,381
But on the other hand, ...

94
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:22,708
... it has its good sides, too. [laughter]

95
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,201
[laughter]

96
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:29,703
[laughter, applause]

97
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:32,980
That's a bit sexist, I know - uhm.

98
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:35,468
"Anyway."

99
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:37,621
Oh, my english word - uhm.

100
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:41,925
Anyway. The biggest problem for a person in a wheelchair like me ...

101
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:43,944
... in a brutal world like Berlin ...

102
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:45,859
... are still the stairs.

103
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:47,643
Stairs at an entrance.

104
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:51,056
Stairs at an entrance - I would say, from my own experience, ...

105
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:53,931
... I can't get into 70 % of the non-wheelchair-accessible stores, ...

106
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:55,311
... because there are ...

107
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:57,898
... at least two steps at the entrance.

108
00:04:57,935 --> 00:05:00,761
Two steps at the entrance - folks, what's the problem?

109
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:03,421
And one day, when a friend Holger and me ...

110
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:06,592
... - uhm - met in a Cafe and we said goodbye, ...

111
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,816
... he said: Raul, sorry! I would really like to see you again, ...

112
00:05:09,854 --> 00:05:13,018
... but I'm tired of always meeting in the same cafe.

113
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:16,248
And I replied: Yes, make a suggestion! Were can we go?

114
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,642
Well, let us go around the corner at our place.

115
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:20,838
I said: Okay! Do you know, if it is wheelchair-accessible?

116
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:23,071
And he said: No.

117
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:26,275
And he answered at the same time by saying:

118
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:29,593
But if there are 1.6 million people in wheelchairs like you, ...

119
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:32,570
... then there must be also 1.6 million people, ...

120
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:32,888
... who know places ...

121
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:35,585
... that are wheelchair-accessible.

122
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:37,791
And that's how the idea of Wheelmap was born.
